# ✅ DevOps Lab – Important Tips and Suggestions

## 📌 Account Creation Tips

To avoid unnecessary charges during the lab work:

- **Use zero-balance digital bank accounts** such as:
  1. **Airtel Payments Bank**
  2. **Jio Payments Bank**
- This avoids large bills since these accounts won't hold significant funds.

> 🔑 *You only need a PAN card to open these accounts.*

### 💳 Google Cloud Account Setup
- Use **UPI details** from the above zero-balance bank accounts.

## 🖥️ Accessing EC2 Instances

You can access your **AWS EC2 instance** using the following methods:

1. **EC2 Instance Connect**  
   - ✔️ Simple and direct (browser-based)  
   - ❌ Limited features, not ideal for multitasking

2. **MobiXterm**  
   - ✔️ Best for handling multiple instances via tabs  
   - ✔️ Friendly GUI with built-in SSH client

3. **Git Bash**  
   - ✔️ Lightweight and smooth terminal experience on Windows  
   - ✔️ Recommended for CLI users

## ⚠️ EC2 Instance Configuration Best Practices

- **Do NOT remove the SSH (port 22) inbound rule** during instance setup.  
  🔒 Without it, you won't be able to SSH using MobiXterm or Git Bash.

- **Always check the box to allow HTTP traffic** when launching an EC2 instance.  
  🌐 Most experiments need this to serve web applications via port 80.
